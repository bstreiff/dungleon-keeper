Dungleon Keeper
===============

This is a repository of past solutions for [Dungleon](https://www.dungleon.com/),
a web-based game where you must guess the dungeon composition.

There are many rules for the composition of a dungeon. Three are provided,
while the others are secret-- and it's exceedingly useful to be able to
refer to past solutions when trying to deduce the secret rules.

This repo replaces a folder of screenshots in a way that is easier to share.
Additionally, it offers some functionality to filter puzzles that only
contain particular pieces.
